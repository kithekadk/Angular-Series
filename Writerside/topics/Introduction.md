## Chapter 1: Introduction
This is a guide to helping you learn angular from basics to advanced concepts. Involves understanding the essentials of building with the framework, developing, testing and deployment of applications build on Angular.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Text Editor
- Angular CLI

#### Installing Angular CLI
> npm install -g @angular/cli
> 
{style="tip"}

### Creating a new project
With angular CLI installed, run `ng new <project-name>` in your terminal.
- Example:
> ng new todolist
> 
{style="note"}

- You will be presented with some configuration options for your project. Use the arrow and enter keys to navigate and select which options you desire.
- After you select the configuration options and the CLI runs through the setup, you should see the following message:

> $ âœ” Packages installed successfully.
> 
> $ Successfully initialized git.
> 
- You are ready to run the project locally

### Running project locally
- Switch to your new Angular project `cd todolist`
- Run `npm start` or `ng serve`
- Once everything is successful open the project on the browser on port `4200` or visit the path `http://localhost:4200`
