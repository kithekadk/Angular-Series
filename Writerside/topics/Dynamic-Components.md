# Dynamic Components


Angular's dynamic component loading feature provides a powerful mechanism for adding components to the DOM programmatically during runtime. This capability is crucial for applications requiring high flexibility, such as dashboards, complex forms, or any context where the UI is not static. This guide explores every facet of dynamic components in Angular 18.

### Introduction to Dynamic Components

Dynamic components are Angular components instantiated at runtime. Unlike static components declared in templates, dynamic components are useful for building applications where the component structure changes based on user actions or data.

### Step 1: Preparing Your Angular Application

To start working with dynamic components, ensure your Angular project is properly set up to support them.

#### Essential Imports and Configuration

You need to import several core Angular modules that facilitate dynamic component loading:

```typescript
import { NgModule, Component, Input, ViewChild, ViewContainerRef, ComponentFactoryResolver, ComponentRef, Directive } from '@angular/core';
```

### Step 2: Define a Target Directive

Create a directive that marks the spot in the template where the dynamic component should be loaded.

```typescript
@Directive({
selector: '[appDynamicInsertion]'
})
export class DynamicInsertionDirective {
    constructor(public viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef) {}
}
```

This directive uses `ViewContainerRef` to provide a reference to the container where the dynamic component will be loaded.

### Step 3: Creating a Dynamic Component

Design a component that you plan to load dynamically. For example, a simple alert component:

```typescript
@Component({
template: '<div>{{ message }}</div>'
})
export class AlertComponent {
    @Input() message: string;
}
```

### Step 4: Loading the Component Dynamically

Implement dynamic loading in your container component. Use `ComponentFactoryResolver` to resolve a component factory for the AlertComponent and add it to the view.

```typescript
@Component({
selector: 'app-dynamic-loader',
template: '<ng-template appDynamicInsertion></ng-template>'
})
export class DynamicLoaderComponent implements AfterViewInit {
    @ViewChild(DynamicInsertionDirective, {static: true}) insertionPoint: DynamicInsertionDirective;

    constructor(private componentFactoryResolver: ComponentFactoryResolver) {}

    ngAfterViewInit() {
        const componentFactory = this.componentFactoryResolver.resolveComponentFactory(AlertComponent);
        const viewContainerRef = this.insertionPoint.viewContainerRef;
        viewContainerRef.clear();
    
        const componentRef = viewContainerRef.createComponent<AlertComponent>(componentFactory);
        componentRef.instance.message = 'Hello from a dynamic component!';
    }
}
```

### Advanced Techniques and Considerations

#### Managing Lifecycle

Dynamically loaded components need careful management to avoid memory leaks. Ensure you handle lifecycle hooks properly.

```typescript
componentRef.onDestroy(() => {
    console.log('Component is destroyed');
});
```

#### Performance Optimization

Loading components dynamically can have performance implications. Optimize by lazy loading components only when necessary, and ensure that unused components are properly destroyed.

> **Warning**: Excessive use of dynamic components without proper management can lead to performance bottlenecks and increased memory usage.

### Step 5: Security Considerations

When loading components dynamically, especially those involving user input or external data sources, consider security implications such as XSS attacks. Sanitize all inputs and use Angular's built-in security features.

```typescript
import { DomSanitizer } from '@angular/platform-browser';

constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {}

sanitizeInput(input: string) {
    return this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(input);
}
```

### Best Practices

- **Memory Management**: Always clean up dynamically created components to free up resources.
- **Performance Considerations**: Use dynamic components judiciously as they can impact performance if not managed correctly.

> **Important**: Be cautious with the context and security implications of dynamically loading components, especially when component inputs depend on external or user-generated content.
